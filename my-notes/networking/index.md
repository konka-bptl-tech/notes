### **1. AWS Networking Components**  
These are the core AWS networking services:  
- **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud)  
- **Subnets** (Public, Private, Isolated)  
- **Route Tables**  
- **Internet Gateway (IGW) & NAT Gateway**  
- **Security Groups & NACLs**  
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** (ALB, NLB)  
- **Route 53** (DNS, Health Checks, Traffic Routing)  
- **CloudFront** (CDN, Caching)  
- **Direct Connect & VPN** (Hybrid Connectivity)  
- **VPC Peering & Transit Gateway**  

### **2. Core Networking Concepts (Must-Know for AWS Networking)**  
- **IP Addressing & Subnetting (CIDR, Private/Public IPs, IPv4 vs. IPv6)**  
- **DNS (A, CNAME, MX, TXT, NS, PTR, SOA Records)**  
- **DHCP (IP Assignment, Lease Time)**  
- **NAT (SNAT, DNAT, PAT - How AWS NAT Gateway Works)**  
- **Firewalls (Security Groups, NACLs, WAF, Network Firewall)**  
- **ISO/OSI model and TCP/IP models**
- **Load Balancing (Round Robin, Least Connections, AWS ELB types: ALB, NLB)**  
- **Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy (Nginx, Squid Proxy, AWS ALB as Reverse Proxy)**  
- **TLS/SSL (HTTPS, Certificates, ACM in AWS)**  
- **CDN & Caching (CloudFront, Edge Locations)**  

### **3. Advanced Networking Concepts (Beyond AWS Basics)**  
- **BGP & Routing (Used in AWS Direct Connect, Transit Gateway, Hybrid Cloud)**  
- **MTU & Packet Fragmentation (How AWS handles large packets & performance tuning)**  
- **TCP vs. UDP (How AWS NLB supports UDP traffic)**  
- **ICMP, Ping, Traceroute (For AWS network troubleshooting)**  
- **Service Mesh (Istio, App Mesh in AWS, Zero Trust Networking)**  
- **Kubernetes Networking (CNI, Network Policies, Pod-to-Pod Communication)**

Your networking curriculum is already very comprehensive—great job! You're covering both AWS-specific components and general networking fundamentals, which is perfect for mastering cloud networking. Here are a few suggestions and additions you might consider to round it out even more:

### ✅ **Suggested Additions**  

#### **3. Advanced AWS Networking Topics**
- **PrivateLink & VPC Endpoints (Gateway & Interface Endpoints)**  
  For secure private connectivity to AWS services and third-party SaaS.
  
- **Egress-Only Internet Gateway (IPv6)**  
  A key component when working with IPv6-only architectures.

- **Network ACL vs Security Group Deep Dive**  
  Include use cases, order of evaluation, stateless vs. stateful.

- **AWS Global Accelerator**  
  For improving global application availability and performance.

- **Elastic IPs & ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces)**  
  Useful for static IPs and advanced failover patterns.

- **Traffic Mirroring & VPC Flow Logs**  
  For deep traffic inspection and network troubleshooting.

- **Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations**  
  To control network-related permissions across accounts.

- **Multicast Support (for EC2/VPC L2 networking scenarios)**  
  Not often used but good to know for hybrid and enterprise migration use cases.

#### **4. Hybrid and Inter-Region Networking**
- **Transit Gateway Connect (for SD-WAN integration)**  
- **Inter-Region VPC Peering vs. Transit Gateway Inter-Region Peering**  
- **Latency, Cost, and Security Implications**  

---

#### **5. Monitoring & Troubleshooting Tools**
- **Reachability Analyzer**
- **VPC Flow Logs (in-depth filtering and analysis with CloudWatch/CloudTrail/SIEM tools)**
- **CloudWatch metrics related to networking (e.g., NAT Gateway, ENI, Load Balancers)**  
- **Network performance insights (P95, P99 latency, packet drops, etc.)**

---

#### **6. Practical Hands-On Skills**
- Designing **hub-and-spoke** network architectures  
- Implementing **multi-account** VPC strategies using **Resource Access Manager (RAM)**  
- Setting up **multi-AZ and multi-region failover**  
- Building a **multi-tier application with private and public subnets**  
- **Simulating DDoS** scenarios and using **AWS Shield + WAF**
