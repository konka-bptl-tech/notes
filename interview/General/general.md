# Tell me about yourself?

Hi, my name is **Sivaramakrishna**, and I have around **4.5 years of experience** as a DevOps Engineer. I’m currently working at **Vaayuja Info Solutions**, where I’ve been responsible for setting up and managing cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines for multiple projects.

My core skill set includes tools and technologies like **AWS**, **Terraform**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Linux**. I also have hands-on experience in implementing automated deployment pipelines using **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions**.

In terms of observability, I’ve worked with **Prometheus and Grafana** for monitoring, and **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for centralized logging and analysis.

**"I’m focused on automating workflows, enhancing system reliability, and building secure, scalable infrastructure in cloud-native environments."**

Hi, my name is **Sivaramakrishna**, and I have around **4.5 years of experience** as a DevOps Engineer. I’m currently working at **Vaayuja Info Solutions**, where I help design, implement, and manage cloud infrastructure and deployment pipelines for various projects.

My technical stack includes **AWS**, **Terraform**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Linux**. I also work extensively with CI/CD tools like **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions** to automate deployments. For monitoring and observability, I use **Prometheus with Grafana**, and for centralized logging, I’ve implemented the **ELK Stack**.

Throughout my career, I’ve consistently **collaborated with cross-functional teams**, including developers, testers, and security teams, to streamline development workflows, solve production issues quickly, and ensure smooth delivery of applications.

I’m passionate about automation, system reliability, and building scalable infrastructure in cloud-native environments.

# What do you discuss with developers, testers, or security teams?

**1. With Developers:**

* I discuss application requirements like what is the programming languagae they are using and it's version port numbers, environment variables, storage needs, and configurations.
* I help them containerize their applications using Docker and guide them on creating proper Dockerfiles.
* We work together to troubleshoot deployment issues in staging or production.
* I also assist them in writing CI/CD pipeline steps that match their build and release flow.

**Example:**
In one project, developers needed help debugging a failed deployment in Kubernetes. I checked the logs, found a config issue in the environment variables, and fixed the Helm chart accordingly.

---

**2. With Testers (QA team):**

* I coordinate with them to ensure that the test environment is stable and matches production.
* I help them with automated test stages in the CI/CD pipeline.
* If any services are failing in test environments, I support them by checking pod logs or network policies.

**Example:**
The QA team reported that their automated tests were failing after a new deployment. I found that the test pods didn't have access to the backend service due to a missing Kubernetes NetworkPolicy rule, which I fixed.

---

**3. With Security Teams:**

* I work with them to apply security best practices like IAM roles, security groups, and data encryption.
* I help with vulnerability scanning for Docker images and implement alerts for suspicious activity in CloudWatch or GuardDuty.
* I also ensure that CI/CD pipelines follow proper secret management using tools like AWS Secrets Manager or GitHub encrypted secrets.

**Example:**
The security team flagged our Docker images as having outdated base images. I automated image scanning using Trivy and updated our base images as part of the CI pipeline.
