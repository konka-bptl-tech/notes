- Provids services like networking , computes, storage, dbs over the internet
- instead of maintainning physical H/W or infra locally let's can manage provides the services to access users on-demmand over the internet 

Benefits of Cloud Computing:
- Sclable
- Cost Efficiency[pay-as-you-go]
- Flexibility[access resources anywhere with an internet connection]
- Reliability[provides high avaialbiltiy]
- Security[follow robust securtiy rules]

Types of Cloud Computing:
- Public Cloud[aws,azure,gcp..]
- Private Cloud[on-premises]
- Hybrid Cloud[public+private]

Types Of Cloud Services:
1. Iaas
- responsible to managing and maintain softwares and applications deployment
- For example as endusers we are not bother about
  - Networkig,Storage,Servers,Virtualization vendor take care
  - OS,App Runtime, applications we take care
2. Paas
- No need to worry about OS,Middleware,Runtime vendor will take care
- beanstalk
- lambda
- gateway
- ecs
3. Saas
- Fully managed service we just use what they provide

region: geographical location
az's: actual datacenters are there

EC2: Create servers offers resizable compute capacity
- scalbility
- variety of offers instances
- ensure secuirty using sg and key-value pair
- integrations with other services
- flexible pricing

Types of instances:
1. General purpose[t,m]
2. Compute Optimized[c][C5]
3. Memory Optimized[r,x1][R5,R4]
4. Storage Optimized[d,i]
5. GPU
6. FPGA


status checks:
1. System Status Checks
2. Instance Status Checks
3. Volume Status Checks
