# SDLC
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is the process followed to develop software in a structured and efficient way.
Steps in SDLC:
1. Requirement Gathering - Understand what the client or user needs
2. Planning - Plan the resources, time, and tasks
3. Design - Create the architecture or design of the software
4. Development - Write the actual code
5. Testing - Test the software to find and fix bugs
6. Deployment - Release the software to users
7. Maintenance - Fix issues and update the software as needed

# Waterfall
Waterfall is a traditional software development model where the process is followed step by step in a fixed order.

In Waterfall, each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It is simple but not flexible to changes once the process starts.

Advantages of Waterfall Model:
1. Simple and easy to understand
2. Works well for small projects with clear requirements
3. Each phase has clear deliverables and a review process
4. Easy to manage due to fixed phases
5. Documentation is produced at every stage
Disadvantages of Waterfall Model:
1. Not flexible to changes once the process starts
2. Difficult to go back to previous stages
3. Poor model for long and complex projects
4. Testing comes late, so bugs may be found very late
5. Not suitable if requirements are not clear at the beginning

# Agile
Agile is a software development approach that focuses on delivering small, working parts of software quickly and continuously, with regular feedback and changes based on customer needs.
It breaks the project into small parts called iterations or sprints (usually 1 to 4 weeks), where each part is planned, developed, tested, and reviewed.
The main goal of Agile is to be flexible, fast, and customer-focused.
Advantages of Agile Model:

1. Flexible to changes even in later stages
2. Continuous feedback from customers
3. Faster delivery of working software
4. Better collaboration between teams and stakeholders
5. Issues are found and fixed early

Disadvantages of Agile Model:

1. Requires experienced team members
2. Hard to predict cost and timeline in the beginning
3. Documentation may be less compared to other models
4. Can be hard to scale for large projects
5. Frequent changes may lead to confusion without proper management
