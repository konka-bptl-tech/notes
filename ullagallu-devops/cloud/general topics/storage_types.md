### ðŸ§± 1. **Block Storage**

* **How it works:**
  Data is split into **fixed-sized blocks**, and each block is stored separately with a unique ID.
* **Access type:**
  Treated like a raw **hard disk drive** â€“ requires a file system to be installed on it.
* **Use case:**
  Databases, Virtual Machines (VMs), boot volumes.
* **Example services:**

  * AWS **EBS** (Elastic Block Store)
  * Azure Disk Storage
  * Google Persistent Disk

> Think of it like a USB drive or SSD: fast, reliable, and best for apps that need low-latency access.

### ðŸ“‚ 2. **File Storage**

* **How it works:**
  Data is stored in a **hierarchical structure** â€“ with folders and files, just like your laptop.
* **Access type:**
  Shared access via **file protocols** like NFS (Linux) or SMB (Windows).
* **Use case:**
  Shared network drives, content management systems, user home directories.
* **Example services:**

  * AWS **EFS** (Elastic File System)
  * Azure File Storage
  * Google Filestore

> Think of it like a shared drive on a company network where multiple users can access files.

### ðŸª£ 3. **Object Storage**

* **How it works:**
  Data is stored as **objects**, each containing the data itself, metadata, and a unique ID.
* **Access type:**
  Accessed via **APIs or web interfaces**, not like a traditional file system.
* **Use case:**
  Storing images, videos, backups, logs, or big data. Great for unstructured data.
* **Example services:**

  * AWS **S3**
  * Azure Blob Storage
  * Google Cloud Storage

> Think of it like a bucket that can store any type of file and you access it using URLs or APIs.
