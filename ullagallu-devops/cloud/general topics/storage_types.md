### üß± 1. **Block Storage**

* **How it works:**
  Data is split into **fixed-sized blocks**, and each block is stored separately with a unique ID.
* **Access type:**
  Treated like a raw **hard disk drive** ‚Äì requires a file system to be installed on it.
* **Use case:**
  Databases, Virtual Machines (VMs), boot volumes.
* **Example services:**

  * AWS **EBS** (Elastic Block Store)
  * Azure Disk Storage
  * Google Persistent Disk

> Think of it like a USB drive or SSD: fast, reliable, and best for apps that need low-latency access.

### üìÇ 2. **File Storage**

* **How it works:**
  Data is stored in a **hierarchical structure** ‚Äì with folders and files, just like your laptop.
* **Access type:**
  Shared access via **file protocols** like NFS (Linux) or SMB (Windows).
* **Use case:**
  Shared network drives, content management systems, user home directories.
* **Example services:**

  * AWS **EFS** (Elastic File System)
  * Azure File Storage
  * Google Filestore

> Think of it like a shared drive on a company network where multiple users can access files.

### ü™£ 3. **Object Storage**

* **How it works:**
  Data is stored as **objects**, each containing the data itself, metadata, and a unique ID.
* **Access type:**
  Accessed via **APIs or web interfaces**, not like a traditional file system.
* **Use case:**
  Storing images, videos, backups, logs, or big data. Great for unstructured data.
* **Example services:**

  * AWS **S3**
  * Azure Blob Storage
  * Google Cloud Storage

> Think of it like a bucket that can store any type of file and you access it using URLs or APIs.

Great addition, Konka! Here's an **enhanced comparison table** with **IOPS**, **Throughput**, and **Latency**‚Äîthese metrics help you understand performance characteristics across storage types and cloud providers.

| Storage Type   | Structure        | Access Method        | Best For                       | AWS Example | Azure Example      | GCP Example         | IOPS                                  | Throughput                     | Latency               |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Block Storage  | Raw Blocks       | Mounted as disk      | Databases, VMs, OS disks       | EBS         | Azure Disk Storage | Persistent Disk     | ‚úÖ High (up to 256K IOPS with EBS io2) | ‚úÖ High (up to GB/s)            | ‚úÖ Low (\~1ms or less) |
| File Storage   | Folder/File Tree | Shared network drive | Shared access, CMS, user data  | EFS         | Azure Files        | Filestore           | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium (scales with usage)         | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium (up to 10+ GB/s)     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium (\~ms)      |
| Object Storage | Flat (Objects)   | API / URL based      | Backups, media, logs, big data | S3          | Azure Blob Storage | Cloud Storage (GCS) | ‚ùå No traditional IOPS (API-based)     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Good for large object reads | ‚ùå Higher (100+ ms)    |

---

### üìå Notes:

* ‚úÖ **High** = Designed for fast access, ideal for latency-sensitive apps like databases.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium** = Decent performance, but not ideal for very high IOPS workloads.
* ‚ùå **Low or Not Applicable** = Not designed for traditional IOPS, higher latency due to API overhead.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)**

* **Definition:**
  The number of **read/write operations** a storage system can perform in one second.
* **Think of it as:**
  How many small transactions (like reading a database row or writing a small file) can happen per second.
* **Example:**
  An AWS EBS `io2` volume can deliver up to **256,000 IOPS**, good for high-performance databases.

---

### üöÄ **Throughput**

* **Definition:**
  The **amount of data** transferred per second, usually measured in **MBps or GBps**.
* **Think of it as:**
  The **speed of the highway** ‚Äî how much data can flow through per second.
* **Example:**
  AWS EFS can deliver up to **10+ GBps** for large data transfers like video files or backups.

---

### ‚ö° **Latency**

* **Definition:**
  The **time delay** between a request and the response ‚Äî how fast the system reacts.
* **Measured in:**
  **Milliseconds (ms)** or **microseconds (¬µs)**.
* **Think of it as:**
  The **reaction time** ‚Äî how quickly the first byte starts coming.
* **Example:**
  AWS EBS typically offers **<1 ms latency**, making it great for low-latency apps like transactional databases.
