# Elastic Block Storage[EBS]
It is a block storage to persist the data we we using EBS volumes these network attached volumes to the EC2 instance
- EBS volumes ensures HA,Scalable and reliable block storage in aws

Key features
- Elasticity can be increase capacity IOPS to met application demands
- Durability Ensures data avialability[data loss]
- Snapshots can we backup the volumes it supports incremental backups
- encryption we can encrypt our volumes to enahnce secuirty
- avialability ensure HA of your storage

We have multiple types of EBS volumes are avialable

- SSD:
  General Purpose:
  - gp2
  - gp3
  Provisioned IOPS:
  - io1
  - io2
- HDD
  - sc1 
  - st1
