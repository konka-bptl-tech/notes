# ✅ Simple Storage Service (S3)
* **Global service**, but **buckets are region-specific**
* **Bucket names must be globally unique** (objects are accessible via URL)
* **Object storage** = Data + Metadata + Unique URL
* Can store **any type of data** (logs, videos, PDFs, images, etc.)
* Common use in orgs:
  * **VPC Flow Logs**
  * **WAF Logs**
  * **CloudTrail Logs**
  * **Application logs**
  * **Access logs**
  * **App images**
* Provides **unlimited storage**
* Max object size: **5 TB**

* **S3 Standard** – frequent access
* **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** – auto cost optimization
* **S3 Standard-IA** – infrequent access
* **S3 One Zone-IA** – infrequent, single AZ
* **S3 Glacier** – archival
  * Instant Retrieval
  * Flexible Retrieval
  * Deep Archive
* **S3 Reduced Redundancy** – legacy (not recommended)

🧱 **Format:**
```
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource
```
🪣 **Example (S3 bucket):**
```
arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket
```

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is designed to provide both **durability** and **high availability**, but they are different concepts. Here's a breakdown of each:
---
## 🔒 **Durability in Amazon S3**
### ✅ What it means:
Durability refers to how reliably your data is stored without loss over time.
### 📊 S3 Durability Guarantee:
**99.999999999% (11 nines)** of durability for objects stored in S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, and S3 Glacier.
### 🛠 How it's achieved:
* **Multiple copies across multiple Availability Zones (AZs)** in a region.
* **Automatic integrity checks** using checksums during upload and at rest.
* **Self-healing**: If a copy becomes corrupted, S3 detects and repairs it automatically using redundant copies.
* **No single point of failure**: Even if one AZ fails completely, your data remains safe.
---
## ⚡ **High Availability in Amazon S3**
### ✅ What it means:
Availability refers to the ability to access your data when you need it.
### 📊 S3 Availability SLA:
**99.9% availability SLA** for S3 Standard.
### 🛠 How it's achieved:
* **Data is accessible from multiple AZs**.
* **Scalable architecture** ensures requests are handled even under high load.
* **Redundant infrastructure** minimizes downtime.
* **Versioning & replication** options increase accessibility and disaster recovery.

# ✅ AWS S3 Notes – Key Points
---
### 🔐 **IAM Policy vs Bucket Policy**
* **IAM Policy (Identity-based):**
  * Attached to **users, groups, or roles**
  * Controls **what resources they can access**
* **Bucket Policy (Resource-based):**
  * Attached **directly to the S3 bucket**
  * Controls **who can access the bucket (including external accounts)**
📝 **Use Case**: To allow/restrict access for specific users to a bucket, use **bucket policies**.
---
### ⏳ **Lifecycle Rules**
* Applied at **12:00 AM UTC**
* **Not immediate** — changes may take hours to reflect
* Used to **transition objects** (e.g., Standard → Glacier) or **expire/delete**
---
### 📄 **S3 Logging Limitations**
* **Only ALB and CLB logs** can be stored in S3
  * These use **HTTP/HTTPS protocols**
* **NLB (TCP-based)** does **not** support direct logging to S3
  * Use **VPC Flow Logs** instead
---
### 🚨 **Production Environment Practices**
* Always **enable access logs** on buckets
* Avoid storing logs in **CloudWatch** due to cost or retention concerns
---
### 🪣 **Multiple ALB Logs in One S3 Bucket**
* Yes, it's possible
* Add **multiple ALB ARNs** to the bucket policy
---
### 🔗 **Pre-signed URLs**
* Used to give **temporary access** to a specific S3 object
* Useful for **secure downloads/uploads** without making the object public
---
# ✅ S3 Bucket Properties – Quick Notes
---
### 1️⃣ **Bucket Versioning**
* Stores **multiple versions** of an object
* Helps **recover from accidental deletions/overwrites**
* Must be **explicitly enabled**
---
### 2️⃣ **Server Access Logging**
* Logs **all requests** made to the bucket
* Delivered to another **target S3 bucket**
* Useful for **audit and security analysis**
---
### 3️⃣ **AWS CloudTrail Data Events**
* Logs **API operations** on objects (e.g., `GetObject`, `PutObject`)
* More detailed than management events
* Must be **explicitly enabled** in CloudTrail
---
### 4️⃣ **Event Notifications**
* Triggers **notifications** for certain object-level events
* Supports **SNS, SQS, or Lambda**
* Events: `PUT`, `DELETE`, `COPY`, etc.
---
### 5️⃣ **Transfer Acceleration**
* Uses **Amazon CloudFront edge locations** to speed up uploads/downloads
* Ideal for **global uploads**
* Must be **enabled per bucket**
---
### 6️⃣ **Object Lock**
* Prevents object modification or deletion
* Supports **WORM (Write Once, Read Many)** compliance
* Use for **regulatory and legal hold** scenarios
---
### 7️⃣ **Static Website Hosting**
* Host static websites from S3
* Configure **index.html** and **error.html**
* Requires **public access settings** and **bucket policy**
---
### 8️⃣ **Requester Pays**
* The **user downloading** the object pays the data transfer costs
* Used in scenarios like **public datasets or analytics sharing**
---
# ✅ S3 Permissions – Explained
---
### 1️⃣ **Bucket Policy (Resource-based Policy)**
* JSON-based policy **attached directly to a bucket**
* Controls **who (users/accounts/roles)** can perform **what actions** on **which resources**
* Can be used to:
  * Allow public access
  * Grant access to other AWS accounts
  * Restrict IPs or use conditions
🧠 **Best for:**
Fine-grained access control at the **bucket or object level**
📝 **Example Use Case:**
Allow only a specific IAM user from another AWS account to `GetObject` from your bucket
---
### 2️⃣ **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**
* Legacy way to control access to **individual objects or buckets**
* Less flexible than bucket policies
* Used to:
  * Make an object public
  * Grant access to AWS accounts
⚠️ **Note:**
Use ACLs only when **bucket policies/IAM policies** are not sufficient. AWS recommends **avoiding ACLs** when possible.
🧠 **Best for:**
Simple use cases like making a specific object public
---
### 3️⃣ **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
* Controls **which domains** can access your bucket **from a web browser**
* Needed when a web app from `domainA.com` tries to access S3 resources hosted at `domainB.com`
🔧 Set via a **CORS configuration JSON** in the bucket settings
📝 **Example Use Case:**
A JavaScript app hosted on `example.com` needs to fetch images from your S3 bucket
---
### 🧠 Summary Table:
| Feature           | Purpose                         | Best Use Case                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Bucket Policy** | Control access using JSON rules | Cross-account access, IP filtering           |
| **ACLs**          | Basic access control (legacy)   | Public object access (simple use)            |
| **CORS**          | Web browser cross-domain access | Allow frontend apps to access S3 via browser |

# ✅ S3 Management – Explained
---
### 1️⃣ **Lifecycle Rules**
* **Automates moving or deleting objects** based on their age
* Helps with **cost optimization** by transitioning data to cheaper storage classes or deleting it
🛠️ **What it can do:**
* Transition to:
  * **S3 Standard-IA**, **One Zone-IA**, **Glacier**, **Deep Archive**
* Delete objects after a certain period
* Expire **non-current versions** (if versioning is enabled)
🕛 **Note:** Lifecycle rules are applied **daily at 12:00 AM UTC**, not immediately.
📝 **Example Use Case:**
* After 30 days, move logs to Glacier
* After 365 days, delete them
---
### 2️⃣ **Replication Rules**
* Automatically **copies objects from one bucket to another**
* Helps with **disaster recovery**, **compliance**, or **cross-region availability**
🛠️ **Types:**
* **Same-Region Replication (SRR)** – within the same region
* **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)** – between different regions
🔑 Requirements:
* Source bucket must have **versioning enabled**
* IAM role must be granted replication permissions
📝 **Use Cases:**
* Maintain a **backup** in another region
* Store a **copy of data closer to users** (latency optimization)
* Meet **compliance** by storing copies in specific regions
