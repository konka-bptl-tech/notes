## 🌩️ Cloud Computing - Notes
### ✅ What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing provides **services like networking, compute power, storage, and databases** over the **internet**, on a **pay-as-you-go** basis.
It removes the need to maintain **physical hardware** or infrastructure locally.

### 🎯 Benefits of Cloud Computing
* **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up/down based on demand.
* **Cost-Efficient**: Pay only for what you use (Pay-as-you-go).
* **Flexibility**: Access from anywhere via internet.
* **Reliability**: High availability and disaster recovery.
* **Security**: Follows strict and robust security practices.

### 🌐 Types of Cloud Deployments
* **Public Cloud**: Services offered by 3rd-party providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
* **Private Cloud**: Used by a single organization, hosted on-premises.
* **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds.

### 🧱 Types of Cloud Services
#### 1. IaaS – *Infrastructure as a Service*
* Vendor manages: Networking, Storage, Servers, Virtualization.
* User manages: OS, Middleware, Runtime, Applications.
* 🧠 Example: EC2, VPC, EBS.
#### 2. PaaS – *Platform as a Service*
* Vendor manages: Networking, Storage, Servers, Virtualization, OS, Middleware, Runtime.
* User manages: Application and Data.
* 🧠 Example: Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, API Gateway, ECS.
#### 3. SaaS – *Software as a Service*
