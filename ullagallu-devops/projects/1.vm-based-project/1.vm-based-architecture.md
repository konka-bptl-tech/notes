# VM based Architecture
Perfect — you're describing two distinct data flow paths from the **Backend**:

1. **Backend → ElastiCache → RDS** (for read-through or write-through caching logic)
2. **Backend → RDS** (direct DB access, possibly for writes or uncached reads)

Here's your updated architecture in a structured text diagram:

```
www.vm.konkas.tech (DNS)
          ↓
CloudFront (CDN, SSL, WAF, Caching)
          ↓
Internal ALB (Private ALB)
          ↓
Frontend (ReactJS on VM, ASG)
          ↓
Internal ALB (Backend)
          ↓
Backend (NodeJS on VM, ASG)
      ↘          ↘
   ElastiCache     RDS (Database)
         ↓
      RDS (Database)
```

### Explanation of Arrows:

* **Backend → ElastiCache → RDS**: Used for caching strategies (e.g., read-through).
* **Backend → RDS**: Used when bypassing the cache (e.g., direct writes or uncached reads).

Would you like this as a **mermaid diagram** or something you can paste into a visual diagramming tool? Here's the **Mermaid.js** version for easy rendering in Markdown-based tools:

```mermaid
graph TD
    DNS[www.vm.konkas.tech (DNS)] --> CF[CloudFront (CDN, SSL, WAF, Caching)]
    CF --> ALB1[Internal ALB (Private ALB)]
    ALB1 --> FE[Frontend (ReactJS on VM, ASG)]
    FE --> ALB2[Internal ALB (Backend)]
    ALB2 --> BE[Backend (NodeJS on VM, ASG)]
    BE --> EC[ElastiCache (Redis)]
    BE --> RDS[RDS (Database)]
    EC --> RDS
```
