Here’s a clean and confident way you can **explain why to choose Kubernetes (EKS) over ECS** in an interview:

---

**🗣️ Interview Answer:**

> In our organization, we evaluated ECS and EKS based on our long-term goals. ECS is tightly integrated with AWS and is great for quick container deployment. But we chose EKS—Kubernetes on AWS—because it offers more flexibility and is cloud-agnostic.
>
> With EKS, we can run the same workloads on any cloud or on-prem environment without vendor lock-in. Kubernetes also provides advanced capabilities like custom controllers, service mesh integration, and better support for GitOps practices using tools like Argo CD and Helm.
>
> Additionally, Kubernetes supports complex workloads, including batch processing, jobs, and custom CRDs. Its large open-source community and ecosystem give us more control and extensibility compared to ECS.
>
> So, while ECS is simpler, we preferred EKS for its scalability, customization, and long-term portability.

You can follow that up with a short line like:

> For small-scale or purely AWS workloads, ECS is perfect. But for platform-standardization and multi-cloud goals, Kubernetes via EKS gives us the edge.
