# Evolution of Compute

## **🔸 1. Physical Machines**

### ➤ What is a Physical Machine?

"A physical machine is a traditional server or computer with dedicated hardware resources like CPU, memory, storage, and a single operating system installed directly on the hardware."

### ➤ Problems with Physical Machines:

* Low hardware utilization
* Applications are tightly coupled to the OS
* Scaling requires more hardware
* Difficult to isolate applications
* High cost and time-consuming provisioning

---

## **🔸 2. Virtual Machines (VMs)**

### ➤ What is Virtualization?

"Virtualization is a technique that allows multiple virtual environments to run on a single physical machine by using a software layer called a hypervisor."

### ➤ What is a Virtual Machine?

"A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical machine that includes its own OS, virtual hardware, and applications. It runs on top of a hypervisor."

### ➤ How Virtualization Solves Physical Machine Problems:

* Enables multiple VMs on a single physical server
* Better hardware utilization
* Improved isolation between workloads
* Easier to scale and manage
* Faster provisioning compared to physical servers

### ➤ Problems with Virtual Machines:

* Each VM includes a full OS, making it heavy
* High resource consumption (CPU, memory)
* Longer boot times
* Slower performance due to hypervisor overhead

---

## **🔸 3. Containers**

### ➤ What is Containerization?

"Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that runs applications in isolated environments using the host OS kernel, instead of a full guest OS."

### ➤ What is a Container?

"A container is a runtime instance of a container image that includes application code, libraries, and dependencies but shares the host OS kernel."

### ➤ How Containers Overcome VM Problems:

* Lightweight and faster than VMs
* Start in seconds
* Consume fewer resources (no full OS)
* Better for microservices and CI/CD pipelines
* Higher density: More containers can run on the same host

### ➤ Disadvantages of Containers:

* Weaker isolation compared to VMs
* Security depends on the host kernel
* OS-level compatibility issues (same kernel required)
* Limited support for GUI-based applications

| Resource Usage  | High (due to full OS)                  | Low (no OS overhead)                   |
| Isolation Level | Strong (hardware-level via hypervisor) | Moderate (OS-level)                    |
| Portability     | Limited (platform-dependent)           | Highly portable                        |
| Use Case        | Monolithic, legacy apps                | Microservices, DevOps, CI/CD pipelines |

## ✅ Benefits of Containers

1. **Lightweight**

   * Containers share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead.
   * Consume fewer resources than VMs.

2. **Faster Startup Time**

   * Containers start in seconds because they don't boot an OS.

3. **Portability**

   * Can run consistently across environments (dev, test, prod) using container runtimes like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

4. **Isolation**

   * Each container runs in its own isolated user space using Linux namespaces and control groups (cgroups).

5. **Resource Efficiency**

   * Better CPU and memory usage since containers run on top of the host OS without duplicating it.

6. **Scalability**

   * Easy to scale horizontally using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

7. **Simplified CI/CD**

   * Containers can be built, tested, and deployed quickly in automated pipelines.

8. **Immutable Infrastructure**

   * Container images are read-only; any change means building a new image, which improves consistency and reduces drift.

9. **Microservices Friendly**

   * Ideal for breaking applications into smaller, manageable services that can be independently deployed and scaled.

10. **Rapid Development and Deployment**

* Containers streamline the development process by allowing developers to build once and run anywhere.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows you to package an application along with all its dependencies, libraries, and environment settings into a single **Docker image**. This image can then be run as a **container** on any system that has the Docker Engine installed.

---

## How Docker Helps Us to Containerize Applications

* Docker provides a **Dockerfile** to define the environment, dependencies, and steps to build the application.
* Using the Dockerfile, Docker creates an **image**, which is a snapshot of the application and its environment.
* That image can be run as a **container**, ensuring the application runs the same everywhere—on any machine or cloud.
* Docker uses **Union File Systems** and **copy-on-write** techniques to make images lightweight and layered.

---

## Benefits of Using Docker

* **Portability**: Docker containers run consistently across different platforms.
* **Consistency**: Avoids issues like "works on my machine" by packaging dependencies inside the container.
* **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own isolated environment.
* **Version Control**: Docker images can be versioned and rolled back easily.
* **Faster Deployment**: Containers can be launched in seconds.
* **Efficient Resource Usage**: Containers share the host OS kernel, consuming less CPU and memory compared to VMs.
* **Integration with CI/CD**: Docker works well with CI/CD tools to automate build, test, and deploy workflows.
* **Modularity**: Encourages building modular apps using microservices architecture.

### 🔸 Docker Architecture

**"Docker follows a client-server architecture. It mainly consists of the Docker client, Docker daemon, Docker images, containers, and registries."**

---

### 🔹 1. Docker Client

> `"The Docker client is the command-line tool that developers use to interact with Docker. When we run a command like 'docker run' or 'docker build', it sends a REST API request to the Docker daemon."`

---

### 🔹 2. Docker Daemon (dockerd)

> `"The Docker daemon is the core service that runs in the background. It listens to API requests and is responsible for building images, running containers, and managing Docker objects like volumes and networks."`

---

### 🔹 3. Docker Images

> `"Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers. Images are built from a Dockerfile and can be stored in a registry. Each image is made of multiple layers for efficient reuse."`

---

### 🔹 4. Docker Containers

> `"Containers are the running instances of images. They are isolated environments where the application runs. Containers are lightweight because they share the host OS kernel instead of having their own OS like VMs."`

---

### 🔹 5. Docker Registries

> `"Registries are used to store and share Docker images. Docker Hub is the default public registry, but we can also use private registries or Amazon ECR to manage our own images."`

---

### 🔸 How to End

**"So overall, the Docker client talks to the daemon, which handles the container lifecycle using images pulled from registries. This architecture allows for fast, consistent, and isolated deployments of applications."**

## 🔹 **Docker Basic Commands**

### 🟢 `docker run --help`

Shows help information about the `docker run` command — including available options, flags, and syntax.
📌 Used when you want to know how to run a container with specific configurations.

---

### 🟢 `docker stats --help`

Displays help for the `docker stats` command, which is used to monitor real-time resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O) of containers.

---

### 🟢 `docker exec --help`

Shows help for the `docker exec` command, which is used to run a command inside a running container.
🔸 Example:

```bash
docker exec -it container_id bash
```

---

### 🟢 `docker rmi <image_id>`

Removes a Docker image from the local system.
🔸 Used to clean up unused or old images.
⚠️ Container using the image must be stopped and removed first.

---

### 🟢 `docker rm <container_id>`

Removes a stopped container.
🧹 Used to clean up containers after they're no longer needed.
➕ You can use `-f` to force remove running containers.

---

### 🟢 `docker stop <container_id>`

Gracefully stops a running container by sending a SIGTERM signal, then SIGKILL if it doesn’t stop in time.

---

### 🟢 `docker ps`

Lists all **running** containers.
Shows details like container ID, image, status, ports, etc.

---

### 🟢 `docker ps -a`

Lists **all containers**, including stopped and exited ones.

---

### 🟢 `docker logs <container_id>`

Displays the logs (STDOUT and STDERR) from a running or stopped container.
Useful for debugging containerized applications.

# Container LifeCycle

**"The Docker container life cycle refers to the different stages a container goes through, from creation to deletion. Each container moves through specific states during its life, like created, running, stopped, and removed. Let me walk you through each step briefly."**

Then continue with:

1. **Created**
   *"A container is created from an image but is not running yet. This is done using `docker create` or internally when `docker run` is used."*
2. **Running**
   *"Once started using `docker run` or `docker start`, the container enters the running state. The application inside the container is actively executing."*
3. **Paused** *(optional, only if you want to show deeper understanding)*
   *"Docker allows pausing a container using `docker pause`. It suspends all processes in the container. `docker unpause` resumes them."*
4. **Stopped (Exited)**
   *"If a container finishes execution or is stopped using `docker stop`, it enters the exited state. It can be restarted again using `docker start`."*
5. **Removed**
   *"If the container is no longer needed, we can delete it using `docker rm`. This removes it permanently from the system."*

---
**Pro Tip** for interview:
End by saying:
**"Understanding the container life cycle is important for managing container states, debugging issues, and automating deployments in CI/CD pipelines."**
