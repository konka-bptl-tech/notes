In Kubernetes, a **Pod** is the **smallest deployable unit** and acts as a **wrapper around one or more containers**. All containers inside a pod share the **same network namespace**, so they communicate with each other using `localhost`. They can also share the **same storage volumes**, which allows data sharing between containers in the pod. Although a pod can have multiple containers, the **best practice is to run one container per pod** to keep the design simple and maintainable.

Each pod gets a **unique IP address**, which stays the same for all containers inside it. Since pods are **ephemeral**, meaning they can be deleted or replaced anytime, it is **not recommended to run standalone pods without a controller** (like a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or StatefulSet). Without a controller, if a pod fails or is deleted, Kubernetes has **no mechanism to automatically recreate it**.

Kubernetes also supports **Static Pods**, which are directly managed by the **kubelet** on a node, without being controlled by the API server. These pods are defined in a manifest file placed in a specific directory on the node (usually `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`). Static Pods are always tied to a specific node and are mainly used to run **self-hosted control plane components**, such as `kube-apiserver`, `kube-controller-manager`, and `kube-scheduler`.

In Kubernetes, every pod contains an **invisible special container** called the **Pause Container**. Its main job is to hold the **network namespace** (net ns) for the pod. When a pod starts, the pause container is created first, and it sets up the **network stack**—including the IP address, routes, and interfaces. All the other containers in the pod are then started and attached to the **same network namespace** as the pause container. This allows all containers within the pod to **communicate with each other using `localhost`**, as they share the same IP address and network space. This design is what makes **inter-container communication inside a pod seamless and efficient**. The pause container does not run any application logic; it simply stays alive to maintain the pod’s network namespace for the lifetime of the pod.


In Kubernetes, the **Pod Lifecycle** refers to the different **phases a pod goes through from creation to termination**. When a pod is created, it starts in the **Pending** phase—this means the pod has been accepted by the API server, but one or more containers have not yet been scheduled or pulled. Once the pod is scheduled and containers start running, it moves to the **Running** phase. If any container inside the pod fails but is restartable, the pod remains in Running state while Kubernetes restarts the container based on the defined **restart policy**.

If all containers complete successfully (i.e., they exit with code 0), the pod moves to the **Succeeded** phase. If a container fails and cannot be restarted based on the policy, the pod enters the **Failed** phase. At the end of its life, a pod may go into the **Terminating** state when it's being gracefully deleted, allowing cleanup before it disappears from the cluster. Throughout this lifecycle, Kubernetes continuously monitors pod health and status using probes and controllers to ensure the desired state is maintained.
