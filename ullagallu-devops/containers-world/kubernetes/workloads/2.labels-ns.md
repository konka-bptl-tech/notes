# Namespaces

In Kubernetes, **Namespaces** provide a way to **logically isolate resources** within a cluster. This isolation helps in achieving **multi-tenancy**, allowing different teams or environments (like dev, test, and prod) to safely share the same cluster. With namespaces, we can **control access** by applying **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** rules specific to each namespace. We can also **restrict resource usage**‚Äîsuch as CPU and memory‚Äîby applying **ResourceQuotas** and **LimitRanges** to prevent one team or app from consuming all cluster resources. Additionally, namespaces help avoid **naming conflicts**, as the same resource name (e.g., a service called `frontend`) can exist in multiple namespaces without collision. This makes it possible to **host multiple applications** and manage them cleanly within the same cluster.

# üìå Labels in Kubernetes

**Labels** are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects (like pods, services, etc.). They are used to **group and organize resources** logically within the cluster.

For example:

```yaml
labels:
  app: frontend
  env: production
```

These labels can help you identify and filter objects using **selectors**, or link them with other Kubernetes resources.

### üîç Selectors in Kubernetes

**Selectors** are used to **filter or select Kubernetes objects** based on their labels.

There are **two types of selectors**:

---

#### 1. Equality-based Selectors

These match exact key-value pairs.

**Example:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=frontend
```

This command lists all pods with the label `app=frontend`.

---

#### 2. Set-based Selectors

These match based on a set of values using `in`, `notin`, or `exists`.

**Example 1:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -l 'env in (dev, test)'
```

This matches pods where the `env` label is either `dev` or `test`.

**Example 2:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -l 'app notin (backend)'
```

This filters out pods with `app=backend`.

**Example 3 (exists):**

```bash
kubectl get pods -l 'env'
```

This lists all pods that have an `env` label, regardless of its value.

# Annotations

---

In Kubernetes, **Annotations** are used to attach **supplementary metadata** to objects. Unlike **Labels**, which are used for grouping, selecting, and filtering objects, **annotations are not meant for identification or selection**. Instead, they allow you to store **arbitrary, non-identifying information** such as build details, timestamps, contact info, external monitoring links, or custom configurations. There are **no restrictions on the content or format** of annotation values‚Äîyou can store long strings, JSON, or even URLs. Annotations are especially useful for tools and automation systems that need to **attach extra data to resources without affecting how Kubernetes behaves or schedules them**.

### üß† Example:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    maintainer: "devops-team@company.com"
    git-commit: "abc123def456"
    description: "This deployment runs the production frontend app"
```
