2. I was just thinking about the time we went to the beach together. We should plan to do that again soon!
3. I can’t believe how fast the week went by. It feels like just yesterday it was Monday!
4. I heard about this new restaurant in town, and it sounds amazing. Have you been there yet?

### At Work / Professional

1. I’m just finishing up some work, but I’ll be free in a few minutes. Can we discuss the project then?
2. I’ve been looking at the report you sent me, and I think we should make a few changes before we present it to the team.
3. I’m going to send you an email with all the details, but if you need anything in the meantime, feel free to reach out.
4. Let’s schedule a quick meeting to talk about the next steps and make sure we’re all on the same page.
5. I’ve been working on the project, and I have some updates. I’ll share them with you as soon as I can.

### Agreeing & Disagreeing

1. I agree with what you said earlier, and I think it’s a good idea to move forward with that approach.
2. That’s a valid point, and I think we should consider it carefully before making any decisions.
3. I see your point, but I think we should also look at it from a different perspective to find the best solution.
4. I understand why you feel that way, but I’m not sure that’s the best option for us right now.
5. I agree with you on most things, but I think we should take a little more time to think it over before making a final decision.

### Making Requests

1. Could you please send me the file when you get a chance? I need it to finish up my work.
2. Would it be possible for you to take a look at the document I shared and let me know if there’s anything I need to change?
3. Can I ask you to help me with this task? It would really make a difference if you could take a look.
4. Would you mind explaining that part again? I just want to make sure I understand it clearly.
5. Could you please let me know if there’s anything else I should do before the meeting?
