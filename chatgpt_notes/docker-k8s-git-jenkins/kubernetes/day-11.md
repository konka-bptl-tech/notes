🌱 CRD (Custom Resource Definition)

- What is it?  
  A CRD lets you create your own custom resource types in Kubernetes — just like how Pods, Services, or Deployments are resource types.

- Why use it?  
  When the default Kubernetes resources aren't enough for your app's needs, you can define your own.

- Example:  
  You can create a custom resource called MyDatabase with fields like replicas, storageSize, etc.
---
🤖 Operator
- What is it?  
  An Operator is a controller that understands how to manage your custom resource (usually built around a CRD).
- What does it do?  
  It automates operational tasks like:  
  - Deploying  
  - Backing up  
  - Upgrading  
  - Scaling
- How?  
  It watches for changes to your custom resource and reacts accordingly — just like how the Deployment controller watches Deployments and creates Pods.
---

🎯 Real-world Analogy

- CRD = A new type of form you introduce in an office, like "VacationRequestForm".
- Operator = A smart assistant who watches for these forms, processes them, sends approval emails, and books flights.

🧠 Summary

| Concept   | Purpose                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| CRD       | Defines a new type of Kubernetes resource |
| Operator  | Automates how to manage that resource     |

## 🔐 Why Use **HashiCorp Vault**?

### 1. **Centralized Secrets Management**
- Store all your secrets (API keys, DB passwords, TLS certs, tokens) in **one secure place**.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in code, config files, or environment variables.

---

### 2. **Dynamic Secrets 🔄**
- Vault can **generate secrets on demand**, like:
  - A **database username/password** that expires after 1 hour.
  - Temporary **AWS credentials** for apps or users.
- Much more secure than static, long-lived secrets.

---

### 3. **Fine-Grained Access Control 🔐**
- Use **policies** to define exactly **who can access what**.
- Integrates with **Kubernetes, LDAP, AWS IAM**, etc.
- Least-privilege principle = only give access to what’s needed.

---

### 4. **Audit Logs & Security Compliance 📜**
- Every action in Vault is logged.
- Helps in meeting compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
- You know **who accessed which secret and when**.

---

### 5. **Secrets Leasing & Revocation ⏳**
- Vault can automatically **expire and revoke secrets** after a defined lease time.
- Great for reducing the blast radius in case of a breach.

---

### 6. **Encryption as a Service 🔐**
- You can use Vault just to encrypt/decrypt data (like a secure HSM).
- You never have to manage encryption keys directly.

---

### 7. **Integrated with DevOps Tools**
- Works seamlessly with:
  - **Kubernetes**
  - **Terraform**
  - **Ansible**
  - CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins)

---

### 🛠️ Real-World Example

Let’s say your app needs access to MySQL.

✅ Without Vault:
- You store the MySQL password in a secret or config.
- Anyone with access to that file or secret can get the password.

✅ With Vault:
- App **authenticates to Vault**
- Vault gives a **temporary MySQL username & password**
- Expires automatically after, say, 1 hour

No password stored anywhere permanently. 🔥

Great! Let’s break down **External Secrets Operator** and **External DNS Controller** — both are super useful in Kubernetes for automating secrets and DNS management 🔄🌐


- Launch EC2 installation
- Install HV
- Disable https
- /etc/vault.d/vault.hcl

## 🔐 **External Secrets Operator (ESO)**

### ✅ What It Is:
A Kubernetes **controller** that **syncs secrets from external secret stores** (like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) into Kubernetes as **native `Secret` objects**.

### 🚀 Why We Use It:
- Avoid storing secrets directly in Git or Kubernetes manifests.
- Automatically pulls the latest version from external stores.
- Keeps secrets **up to date and in sync**.

### 🛠️ How It Works:
- You define a `SecretStore` or `ClusterSecretStore` (backend info)
- Then define an `ExternalSecret` that maps external secrets to K8s `Secrets`.

### 🔗 Supported Backends:
- AWS Secrets Manager
- AWS Parameter Store (SSM)
- HashiCorp Vault
- Azure Key Vault
- GCP Secret Manager

## 🌐 Ingress in Kubernetes

---

### 📌 What is **Ingress**?
- **Ingress** is a **Kubernetes API object** that manages **external access** to services in a cluster.
- It acts as a **Layer 7 (Application Layer) Load Balancer**, routing external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to internal services **based on rules** (host/path).

---

### ⚙️ Ingress vs Traditional Load Balancers

#### 🔸 Layer 4 Load Balancer (Transport Layer)
- Just forwards traffic (e.g., TCP) to backend pods.
- **No routing intelligence** — no path or host-based decisions.
- Doesn’t inspect or modify the request.
- Works like a **traffic distributor**.

#### 🔹 Layer 7 Load Balancer (Application Layer)
- Smart routing based on:
  - **Hostnames** (e.g., `mail.google.com`)
  - **Paths** (e.g., `/api`, `/admin`)
- Supports:
  - URL rewrites
  - SSL termination
  - Authentication
  - Header-based routing

---

### 📥 Examples of Host-Based Routing
| Hostname | Service |
|----------|---------|
| `www.google.com` | Google Search |
| `drive.google.com` | Google Drive |
| `mail.google.com` | Gmail |
| `calendar.google.com` | Google Calendar |
| `meet.google.com` | Google Meet |
| `photos.google.com` | Google Photos |
| `maps.google.com` | Google Maps |

---

### 🛡️ Why not just use NodePort or LoadBalancer?

| Method | Issues |
|--------|--------|
| **NodePort** | Exposes ports on every node – **not secure**, hard to manage. |
| **LoadBalancer** | Creates a **dedicated L4 load balancer per service** – very **expensive** and **not scalable**. |

✅ **Ingress** provides a **centralized**, **secure**, and **cost-effective** solution for routing multiple apps.

---

### 🚦 Ingress Request Flow
**Browser** → **DNS Resolution** → **TCP 3-Way Handshake** →  
**Load Balancer (L7)** → **Ingress Controller** → **K8s Service** → **Pod**

---

### 📄 Summary

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ingress Resource** | Defines routing rules (host/path) |
| **Ingress Controller** | Enforces rules and routes traffic accordingly |
| **Example** | `api.example.com` → routes to `backend-service` |


## 🌐 **External DNS Controller**

### ✅ What It Is:
A Kubernetes controller that **automatically manages DNS records** (like A/CNAME records) in external DNS providers based on Ingress or Service annotations.

### 🚀 Why We Use It:
- Automates DNS updates when services are deployed.
- No need to manually update DNS records.
- Super helpful in dynamic, auto-scaling environments.

### 📦 Supported DNS Providers:
- Route53 (AWS)
- Google Cloud DNS
- Azure DNS
- Cloudflare
- GoDaddy
- Many more...

### 🛠️ How It Works:
- You deploy ExternalDNS in your cluster.
- It watches Ingress or Service resources with proper annotations.
- It creates/updates/deletes DNS records in the configured DNS provider.

## 🧩 Quick Example Use Case

| Tool | Example |
|------|---------|
| **External Secrets Operator** | Pull DB password from AWS Secrets Manager into K8s secret |
| **External DNS Controller** | Create a DNS record `api.example.com` → points to a LoadBalancer IP |
