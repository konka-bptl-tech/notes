🌱 CRD (Custom Resource Definition)

- What is it?  
  A CRD lets you create your own custom resource types in Kubernetes — just like how Pods, Services, or Deployments are resource types.

- Why use it?  
  When the default Kubernetes resources aren't enough for your app's needs, you can define your own.

- Example:  
  You can create a custom resource called MyDatabase with fields like replicas, storageSize, etc.

🤖 Operator
- What is it?  
  An Operator is a controller that understands how to manage your custom resource (usually built around a CRD).
- What does it do?  
  It automates operational tasks like:  
  - Deploying  
  - Backing up  
  - Upgrading  
  - Scaling
- How?  
  It watches for changes to your custom resource and reacts accordingly — just like how the Deployment controller watches Deployments and creates Pods.

🎯 Real-world Analogy

- CRD = A new type of form you introduce in an office, like "VacationRequestForm".
- Operator = A smart assistant who watches for these forms, processes them, sends approval emails, and books flights.

## 🔐 Why Use **HashiCorp Vault**?

### 1. **Centralized Secrets Management**
- Store all your secrets (API keys, DB passwords, TLS certs, tokens) in **one secure place**.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in code, config files, or environment variables.

---

### 2. **Dynamic Secrets 🔄**
- Vault can **generate secrets on demand**, like:
  - A **database username/password** that expires after 1 hour.
  - Temporary **AWS credentials** for apps or users.
- Much more secure than static, long-lived secrets.

---

### 3. **Fine-Grained Access Control 🔐**
- Use **policies** to define exactly **who can access what**.
- Integrates with **Kubernetes, LDAP, AWS IAM**, etc.
- Least-privilege principle = only give access to what’s needed.

---

### 4. **Audit Logs & Security Compliance 📜**
- Every action in Vault is logged.
- Helps in meeting compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
- You know **who accessed which secret and when**.

---

### 5. **Secrets Leasing & Revocation ⏳**
- Vault can automatically **expire and revoke secrets** after a defined lease time.
- Great for reducing the blast radius in case of a breach.

---

### 6. **Encryption as a Service 🔐**
- You can use Vault just to encrypt/decrypt data (like a secure HSM).
- You never have to manage encryption keys directly.

---

### 7. **Integrated with DevOps Tools**
- Works seamlessly with:
  - **Kubernetes**
  - **Terraform**
  - **Ansible**
  - CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins)

---

### 🛠️ Real-World Example

Let’s say your app needs access to MySQL.

✅ Without Vault:
- You store the MySQL password in a secret or config.
- Anyone with access to that file or secret can get the password.

✅ With Vault:
- App **authenticates to Vault**
- Vault gives a **temporary MySQL username & password**
- Expires automatically after, say, 1 hour

No password stored anywhere permanently. 🔥

Great! Let’s break down **External Secrets Operator** and **External DNS Controller** — both are super useful in Kubernetes for automating secrets and DNS management 🔄🌐


- Launch EC2 installation
- Install HV
- Disable https
- /etc/vault.d/vault.hcl

## 🔐 **External Secrets Operator (ESO)**

### ✅ What It Is:
A Kubernetes **controller** that **syncs secrets from external secret stores** (like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) into Kubernetes as **native `Secret` objects**.

### 🚀 Why We Use It:
- Avoid storing secrets directly in Git or Kubernetes manifests.
- Automatically pulls the latest version from external stores.
- Keeps secrets **up to date and in sync**.

### 🛠️ How It Works:
- You define a `SecretStore` or `ClusterSecretStore` (backend info)
- Then define an `ExternalSecret` that maps external secrets to K8s `Secrets`.

### 🔗 Supported Backends:
- AWS Secrets Manager
- AWS Parameter Store (SSM)
- HashiCorp Vault
- Azure Key Vault
- GCP Secret Manager

# Install HV controller in K8s
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Add HV helm repo"
helm repo add external-secrets https://charts.external-secrets.io

echo "install hv"
helm install external-secrets \
   external-secrets/external-secrets \
    -n kube-system
```
# Execrcise
1. Create EC2 instance and install HashiCorp Vault
2. Disable TLS certifcate
3. Access HV using <NodeIP>:<8200>
4. Enter No of Key Shares are require for example 1 enter sahre root token and key shares
5. Enter Asks key share enter key share earlier saved and then token
6. Create Secret Engine --> Enable New Engine --> Choose KV --> change path to desired name for example backend
7. enter path Store secrets and save it
8. Create a Policy name any name for example  
```yaml
#hv-policy-dev.hcl 
path "backend/data/dev" {
    capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}
```
- and then save it
9. Create Cluster Secret store
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vault-token
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  token: [token] #base64 encoded
---
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterSecretStore
metadata:
  name: vault-backend
spec:
  provider:
    vault:
      server: "http://ws.bapatlas.site:8200/" # HV address
      path: "backend" # root path of your secrets in HV
      version: "v2"
      auth:
        tokenSecretRef:
          name: "vault-token"
          key: "token"
          namespace: kube-system
# kubectl apply -f clustersecretstore.yaml
```
10. Create External Secret Store
```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: # name of externalsecret store
spec:
  refreshInterval: "5s"
  secretStoreRef:
    name: # CluasterSecretStoreName
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  target:
    name: # After Getting Secrets it stores the with this name
  dataFrom:
    - extract:
        key: # Key of Secret Store for example we store as dev
# kubectl apply -f externalsecretstore.yaml
```
Here you go:
