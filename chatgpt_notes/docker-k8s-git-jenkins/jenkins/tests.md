In CI/CD pipelines, various types of tests are used at different stages to ensure code quality, functionality, security, and performance. Here's a breakdown of the common types of tests:

---

### 🧪 **1. Unit Tests**

* **Purpose:** Test individual functions or components in isolation.
* **Tools:** JUnit (Java), pytest (Python), Jest (JavaScript), etc.
* **When:** Early in the pipeline, after code is pushed.

---

### 🔗 **2. Integration Tests**

* **Purpose:** Test interactions between components (e.g., backend ↔️ database).
* **Tools:** Postman, REST Assured, pytest with mock services.
* **When:** After unit tests, before deployment to staging.

---

### 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️ **3. Functional / End-to-End (E2E) Tests**

* **Purpose:** Simulate real user scenarios to test the system as a whole.
* **Tools:** Selenium, Cypress, Playwright.
* **When:** After deployment to staging or test environments.

---

### 🛡️ **4. Security Tests**

* **Purpose:** Detect vulnerabilities and insecure code.
* **Types:**

  * **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Scans code before deployment.
  * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Scans running apps.
* **Tools:** SonarQube, Snyk, OWASP ZAP.

---

### 🧱 **5. Static Code Analysis**

* **Purpose:** Check for code quality, standards, and potential bugs without running the code.
* **Tools:** SonarQube, ESLint, Flake8.

---

### 🔬 **6. Smoke Tests**

* **Purpose:** Quick checks to verify basic functionality after deployment.
* **When:** Immediately after deployment to test or staging.

---

### 🕵️ **7. Regression Tests**

* **Purpose:** Ensure that new changes don’t break existing features.
* **Tools:** Automated test suites from QA.
* **When:** After code merge or during staging validation.

---

### 📈 **8. Performance Tests**

* **Purpose:** Measure responsiveness, load handling, and stability.
* **Types:** Load testing, stress testing, soak testing.
* **Tools:** JMeter, Locust, Gatling.

---

### 🧪 **9. Acceptance Tests**

* **Purpose:** Validate the application against business requirements.
* **Who:** Often written or verified by QA or product team.
* **Tools:** Cucumber, Behave (for BDD).

---

### ⚙️ **10. Deployment Verification Tests**

* **Purpose:** Validate that the deployment process itself succeeded.
* **Examples:** API health checks, endpoint availability.

Certainly! Here's a simplified flow diagram illustrating how various tests fit into a CI/CD pipeline:

### 🔁 **CI/CD Pipeline Testing Flow**

1. **Source Code Management**

   * **Trigger:** Code commit or pull request.
   * **Actions:** Code linting, static code analysis.

2. **Build Stage**

   * **Actions:** Compile code, package artifacts.
   * **Tests:** Unit tests to validate individual components.

3. **Test Stage**

   * **Actions:** Deploy to test environment.
   * **Tests:**

     * Integration tests to verify interactions between components.
     * Functional tests to ensure features work as intended.
     * Performance tests to assess responsiveness and stability.
     * Security tests to identify vulnerabilities.

4. **Staging Deployment**

   * **Actions:** Deploy to staging environment.
   * **Tests:** End-to-end tests simulating real user scenarios.

5. **Production Deployment**

   * **Actions:** Deploy to production environment.
   * **Tests:** Smoke tests to confirm basic functionality.

This flow ensures that code changes are thoroughly tested at each stage before reaching production, enhancing software quality and reliability.([Medium][1])
