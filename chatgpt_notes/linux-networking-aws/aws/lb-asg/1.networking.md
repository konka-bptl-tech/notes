# What are ISO/OSI and TCP/IP Models
‚úÖ Both are reference models that explain how data travels from one device (like your laptop) to another (like a server) over a network.
‚úÖ They break down the complex communication process into layers, where each layer has a specific role.
‚úÖ Purpose:
- To standardize networking.
- To help different systems and technologies "talk" to each other.
- To troubleshoot and design networks easily.

# üéØ Overview:  
When you type `www.google.com` and hit Enter, two major things happen first:  
1. **DNS Resolution** (get IP address)  
2. **TCP Handshake** (build a connection)  
then, **actual data transfer** happens.

# üéØ Simple Flow Summary:
```
You type www.google.com ‚Üí
DNS resolution ‚Üí
IP address found ‚Üí
TCP 3-way handshake ‚Üí
Secure connection established ‚Üí
HTTP GET request sent ‚Üí
Google's response received ‚Üí

# üåê ISO/OSI Model (7 Layers)
| Layer No. | Name | What it Does | Real-Life Example |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| 7 | Application | Interface for users and apps to access network | Web browser, Email app |
| 6 | Presentation | Translates data (encryption, compression) | SSL/TLS (HTTPS), JPEG, MP3 |
| 5 | Session | Starts, manages, and ends communication sessions | API session, login session |
| 4 | Transport | Breaks data into chunks, ensures correct delivery | TCP, UDP |
| 3 | Network | Decides the route/path data should take | IP address, Routers |
| 2 | Data Link | Packages data for local network travel | MAC address, Ethernet |
| 1 | Physical | Actual hardware transmission | Cables, WiFi signals, Fiber optics |

# üåê TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
| Layer No. | Name | What it Does | Real-Life Example |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| 4 | Application | User interface + data formatting (merges OSI Layer 5,6,7) | HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP |
| 3 | Transport | Reliable delivery of data | TCP, UDP |
| 2 | Internet | Logical addressing and routing | IP address, Routers |
| 1 | Network Access | Physical transmission (merges OSI Layer 1 and 2) | Ethernet, WiFi, ARP |

# üìú Quick Notes:

‚úÖ **OSI Model** = 7 detailed layers (theoretical, good for learning)  
‚úÖ **TCP/IP Model** = 4 real-world layers (practical, used on the internet)
‚úÖ **TCP/IP** is like a simplified version of **OSI** that people actually use every day.

### 1. **Proxy**
A **proxy** is an intermediary server that sits between your device (like your computer) and the internet (or another server). It helps to forward requests and responses between the client and the destination server, offering benefits like **security**, **privacy**, and **load balancing**.
### **Forward Proxy**
- **What is it?**  
  A **forward proxy** sits between a **client** (like your computer or browser) and the **internet**. It forwards requests from the client to the destination server.
- **How does it work?**  
  When your device makes a request to access a website, the **forward proxy** receives the request and **forwards** it to the target server (like `www.google.com`). The response from the server comes back to the **forward proxy**, and it sends it to the client.
- **Where is it used?**  
  - **Privacy and security**: Hides the client's real IP address.
  - **Bypass restrictions**: Helps users bypass geo-blocked websites.
  - **Content filtering**: Used in organizations to restrict access to certain websites.
- **Example**:  
  - You are in an office and want to visit a website. The request goes through a **forward proxy** that checks the content, maybe blocks some sites (like social media), and then forwards the rest of the request.
---
### **Reverse Proxy**
- **What is it?**  
  A **reverse proxy** sits between the **internet** and the **servers** you own (e.g., web servers). Instead of the client directly interacting with the web server, it interacts with the **reverse proxy**, which then forwards the request to the appropriate server.
- **How does it work?**  
  When someone (a user) tries to access your website, the request first goes to the **reverse proxy**, which decides which server to send the request to (based on load, type of request, etc.). The server responds to the **reverse proxy**, and then the proxy forwards the response to the client.
- **Where is it used?**  
  - **Load balancing**: Distributes traffic to different backend servers to prevent overload.
  - **Security**: Protects backend servers by hiding them from direct exposure to the internet.
  - **Caching**: A reverse proxy can cache frequently requested data, speeding up response times.
- **Example**:  
  - A user requests `www.yourwebsite.com`. The **reverse proxy** decides whether the request should go to **Server A** (for static content like images) or **Server B** (for dynamic content like a database). The proxy then sends the response to the user.

### **Key Differences**:
| **Forward Proxy** | **Reverse Proxy** |
|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| Sits between the **client** and the **internet**. | Sits between the **internet** and the **web server(s)**. |
| Clients use it to **access external services** (like websites). | The server uses it to **manage incoming requests** to multiple servers. |
| Typically used for **security, anonymity, and filtering**. | Typically used for **load balancing, security, and caching**. |
| Examples: Browsing the web with restricted access, hiding client identity. | Examples: Load balancing for websites, SSL termination. |

### 1. **What is SSL and TLS?**
- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** are protocols used to secure data communication between two computers (like your browser and a server).
- **SSL** is the older, outdated version, while **TLS** is the modern, more secure version.
---
### 2. **Why do we secure the connections between two computers?**
- **To protect sensitive data** from being intercepted by attackers (e.g., passwords, credit card info).
- **To ensure privacy** and **integrity** of the data exchanged between devices.
- **To verify identity**, ensuring you're communicating with the correct server (not a fake one).
---
### 3. **What is SSL Termination?**
- **SSL Termination** refers to the process where an **SSL/TLS connection** is decrypted by a **proxy or load balancer** (instead of the server itself).
- This allows the server to handle regular, unencrypted traffic, reducing its processing load.
